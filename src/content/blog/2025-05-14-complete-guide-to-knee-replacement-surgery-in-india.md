# Complete Guide to Knee Replacement Surgery in India

**Introduction:** Knee replacement (arthroplasty) is a common surgery to replace a damaged knee joint with an artificial implant. It is often recommended when severe knee pain and stiffness (usually from osteoarthritis or injury) interfere with daily activities. Patients who struggle to walk, climb stairs or sit comfortably may be advised to consider surgery. In a *total knee replacement*, the entire joint is resurfaced; in a *partial knee replacement*, only the damaged compartment is replaced. Modern advances include minimally invasive and robotic techniques that help restore mobility and reduce pain.

## Why India is a Preferred Destination for Knee Replacement

**High Quality at Lower Cost:** India is a global hub for medical tourism, and knee surgery is among the top services sought. Patients benefit from significant cost savings (often **50–70% less** than in Western countries) without compromising quality. For example, knee replacement in India can cost around **\$3,500–9,000**, compared to roughly \$15–21k in the U.K. and over \$40,000 in the U.S. At the same time, India’s hospitals offer world-class care. Leading facilities maintain international accreditations (JCI, NABH) and use modern operating rooms (with HEPA filters and laminar airflow to minimize infection risk). Indian orthopaedic surgeons are highly trained — many have practiced or trained in the U.S. and Europe — and they follow global standards of care. English is widely spoken in hospitals, and international patient departments typically offer interpreter and concierge services. These factors – skill, safety, and savings – make India an attractive option for knee replacement.

## Top Orthopedic Hospitals in India

India has many hospitals renowned for joint replacement. Some leading centres include:

* **Apollo Hospitals (New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, etc.)**
* **Fortis Healthcare (Gurgaon, Delhi, Bangalore)**
* **Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (Kochi)**
* **Medanta – The Medicity (Gurgaon)**
* **Max Super Speciality Hospital (New Delhi)**
* **Manipal Hospitals (Bengaluru, Dwarka Delhi)**
* **Narayana Health (Bengaluru, Gurugram, Kolkata)**
* **BLK-Max Hospital (Delhi)**
* **Artemis Hospital (Gurgaon)**
* **Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (Mumbai)**


These hospitals have dedicated orthopaedic departments, experienced surgeons, and offer packages that include surgery, hospital stay, therapy, and follow-up support.

## Cost of Knee Replacement: India vs UK/US

In India, a total knee replacement typically costs **\$3,500–9,000** (roughly INR 2.5–7 lakh), depending on implant type and hospital class. In contrast, it can cost **\$15,000–21,000** in the U.K. and **\$49,000** in the U.S. Indian packages often include surgeon’s fees, hospital stay, medications, and basic rehab. Travel and accommodation costs in India are also lower.

## Preparing for Treatment in India (Visa, Records, Accommodation)

* **Medical Visa:** Apply for a medical visa with a hospital invitation and doctor’s summary.
* **Medical Records:** Carry X-rays, MRI, blood reports in English.
* **Accommodation:** Book through hospital IPS or travel sites near the hospital.
* **Travel Insurance:** Consider international health insurance.
* **Language:** English is widely used; interpreter services available.
* **Currency:** Carry international credit cards and local cash.
* **Health Precautions:** Vaccinate, drink bottled water, avoid raw food.
* **Packing:** Loose clothes, prescriptions, personal meds.
* **Flights:** Wait 3–6 weeks post-surgery before flying.

## The Knee Replacement Treatment Journey

1. **Initial Consultation:** Share medical records and get teleconsultation.
2. **Arriving in India:** In-person evaluation, final pre-op tests.
3. **Pre-Operative Preparation:** Medication review and admission.
4. **Surgery:** 1–2 hours under anesthesia, robotic options available.
5. **Hospital Stay:** 2–4 days with physiotherapy.
6. **Rehabilitation:** Continue physiotherapy and mobility training.
7. **Post-Op Check-ups:** Before returning home.
8. **Return Home:** Stay 2–4 weeks in India after surgery.

## Recovery Timeline and Follow-Up Care

* **Days 0–3:** Stand and walk with support.
* **Weeks 1–3:** Walk short distances, climb stairs slowly.
* **Weeks 4–6:** Resume normal activities, continue rehab.
* **3 Months:** Major recovery achieved.
* **6–12 Months:** Full recovery, avoid high-impact sports.

Most patients enjoy pain-free mobility and return to daily activities after 2–3 months. Over 90% of knee implants function well even after 15 years.
